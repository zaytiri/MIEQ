# MIEQ
 A simple query builder.

# How to use

1. Download the latest version of _mieq-vx.x.x.jar_ file available in the Releases page.
2. Move the download .jar file into the following project:
    ``<your_project>/libs/``
    
    - 'libs' can be any folder created by the user. This is just a suggestion.
3. Add the following dependency in your project's build.gradle:
    ```
    dependencies {
        implementation files('libs/mieq-vx.x.x.jar')
    }
    ```
4. Reload Gradle.

Note: Replace the _vx.x.x_ for the downloaded version.
